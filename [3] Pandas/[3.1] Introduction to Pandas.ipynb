    "### Note about DataFrame Indices and Display\n",
    "In Pandas, each row in a DataFrame has an index. By default:\n",
    "- Indices start at 0 (unlike Excel which starts at 1)\n",
    "- The `head()` function shows the first 5 rows (indices 0-4)\n",
    "- These numbers on the left are just row labels, not data values\n",
    "- You can think of them like line numbers or row IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "When we display DataFrame results using `print(df.head())`, you'll see:\n",
