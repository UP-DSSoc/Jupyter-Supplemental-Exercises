Welcome to the first installment in the Jupyter Supplemental Exercise series of the UP Data Science Society. 

In this workshop, we shall introduce you to Python fundamentals, namely primary methods and fundamentals crucial to writing code for data science and analytics, as well as for any other viable scenario where data processing is crucial and involved.

### Section 1: Basics, List, String Formatting
This section introduces you to Python's basic syntax structure and data types, as well as ways to write variables and execute operations within the language. The exercise also introduces you to simple string formatting, which may be useful going forward when needing to write output in string-format text.

### Section 2: Functions and Packages
This section introduces the function syntax and use of `numpy`, one of many popular Python packages and a very crucial package in the field of data science and analytics. By the end of this, you should be able to know how to create your own function, as well as utilize NumPy's suite of tools to manipulate and create various types of arrays.

### Section 3: Logic and Control Flow
Logic and Control Flow teaches you how to use Python's conditional and loop logic. This section also includes examples employing graph expressions that are brief look into the `matplotlib` library.

### Section 4: Advanced Python - Classes and Objects
The final section in this folder teaches you how to write your own objects, as Python is primarily an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language. When coding in Python, you are building applications using a series of "objects", and this module should teach you how to build your own when building your own applications in the future.
